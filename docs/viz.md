# Visualization gallery

The `sinchole.viz` module draws sinchole's own objects (kernels, stencils, lattices,
reads, receipts) on top of [eyepiece](https://eyepiece.readthedocs.io). It
is an optional extra, `pip install "sinchole[viz]"`, and importing sinchole
never imports it. Every function takes either the sinchole object or plain
arrays, draws into an `ax` you pass or a new figure, and returns an eyepiece
`PlotResult`. Every function except `plot_kernel`, `plot_spacing_rule` and
`plot_check_residuals` also provides an `update` method that redraws in place
for animations. The
figures on the theory and practice pages are built from these functions.

:::{admonition} What the gallery cells need
:class: note

The cells for `plot_read`, `plot_residual`, `plot_check_residuals` and
`plot_band_spectrum` run on the toy coronagraph in `docs/toy_coronagraph.py`
of the repository (a Lyot coronagraph computed on the page, described on
{doc}`theory/band-limits`). That file is documentation scaffolding and not part of the
package: it supplies images and a delivery to draw. Every other cell needs
only sinchole and eyepiece.
:::

```{code-cell} python
import hwostyle
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import sinchole as sc
from sinchole import viz
import toy_coronagraph as tc

jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)
hwostyle.use("dark")
```

## `plot_kernel`

The Kaiser-sinc weights ({doc}`foundations/sinc-interpolation`, {doc}`theory/kernel`)
against offset from the query, with the ideal sinc behind them and the support
edges at $\pm16$ samples. Look at the tails: the sinc keeps oscillating past the
edges, and the tapered kernel decays smoothly to zero at them.

```{code-cell} python
result = viz.plot_kernel()
plt.show()
```

## `plot_stencil`

One axis of a read: the 32 stencil taps and their weights at a query
({doc}`foundations/sinc-interpolation`), here on a grid of 30 stored nodes. Look at
the hollow stems: they are taps at node indices below zero, before the first
stored node, and a read with such taps is refused unless the grid is a quadrant
that reads them by mirror symmetry.

```{code-cell} python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 2.4), constrained_layout=True)
result = viz.plot_stencil(3.3, origin=0.0, spacing=1.0, n_nodes=30, ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## `plot_stencil_2d`

The 1024 taps of one read over the node lattice (the 32 by 32 block of the
stencil in two dimensions), marker area proportional to the weight and color for
its sign. Look at the few large markers near the query: most of the 1024 taps
are too small to see. Taps are counted largest first with `order="weight"`.
`n_taps` sets how many are counted, and `fold` (quadrant lattices only, 0 to 1)
slides each tap that lies at a negative node onto the stored node it reads
through the mirror symmetry of {doc}`theory/quadrant-symmetry`. This cell needs
no delivery, only a lattice.

```{code-cell} python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5), constrained_layout=True)
result = viz.plot_stencil_2d((1.0, 2.0), ((0.0, 0.0), (0.38, 0.38), (31, 31)),
                             quadrant=True, order="weight", n_taps=200,
                             fold=1.0, max_area=600.0, ax=ax)
ax.set_xlim(-6, 8)
ax.set_ylim(-4, 10)
plt.show()
```

## `plot_coverage`

Stored nodes, mirrored nodes of a quadrant grid, the region where complete
stencils exist (the served region of the {doc}`reference/glossary`), a domain
and one read's stencil rectangle. Look at where the stencil rectangle sits
against the region: a read is served only if the rectangle lies inside it.

```{code-cell} python
lattice = sc.Lattice(jnp.zeros(2), jnp.full(2, 0.38), (31, 31))
domain = sc.Domain("box", "closed", jnp.array([[-5.0, -5.0], [5.0, 5.0]]), jnp.zeros(2))
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5), constrained_layout=True)
result = viz.plot_coverage(lattice, domain=domain, quadrant=True, query=(1.0, 2.0), ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## `plot_spacing_rule`

The chain from support width to the delivered grid: bandwidth, largest
admissible spacing, node count and the quadrant lattice, drawn panel by panel on
the {doc}`index` page and explained on {doc}`theory/band-limits` (bandwidth) and
{doc}`theory/quadrant-symmetry` (node count and grid). Pass physical inputs,
or a `Products` and a `Lattice` to draw a delivery. This cell needs neither.

```{code-cell} python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 2.6), constrained_layout=True)
result = viz.plot_spacing_rule(support_width=1.0, radius=(4.18, 5.70), ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## `plot_read` and `plot_residual`

A read on a logarithmic scale in $\lambda_0/D$, and its difference from a
reference image relative to the local peak (the brightest reference pixel
within 1 $\lambda_0/D$ of the source, see the {doc}`reference/glossary`), with that
radius drawn around the source. Look at the right panel: the residual is a
small fraction of the local peak.

```{code-cell} python
toy = tc.ToyCoronagraph()
delivery = tc.quadrant_delivery()
reader = tc.reader_for(delivery)
query = jnp.array([3.2, 1.1])
read = reader.read(query, jnp.int32(0))
truth = toy.psf(query)
pixels = delivery["products"].pixels
fig, (a, b) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(9, 3.8), constrained_layout=True)
viz.plot_read(read, pixels=pixels, ax=a)
viz.plot_residual(read, truth, source_xy_lod=query, pixels=pixels, ax=b)
for ax in (a, b):
    ax.set_xlim(-1, 7)
    ax.set_ylim(-3, 5)
plt.show()
```

## `plot_check_residuals`

The empirical evidence in an admission receipt: interior checks, mirror
checks and axis invariance, with exact zeros gathered at the left edge as
triangles. The dashed lines mark the target of $10^{-5}$ for the interior checks
and the symmetry tolerance of $10^{-6}$ for the other two
({doc}`validation`, {doc}`reference/numerical-contract`).

```{code-cell} python
admission = sc.admit_grid(**delivery)
result = viz.plot_check_residuals(admission.receipt)
plt.show()
```

## `plot_band_spectrum`

The amplitude spectrum of a function sampled along source position, with
the pupil band shaded. The frequency axis is in cycles per $\lambda_0/D$ of
source motion, and the call below passes the sample step 0.05 and a bandwidth
of 1 in those units ({doc}`foundations/sampling`). Look for the spectrum falling
away to the right of the shaded band.

```{code-cell} python
s = np.arange(-512, 512) * 0.05
images = toy.psf(np.stack([s, np.full_like(s, 0.5)], axis=1))
trace = np.asarray(images[:, 50, 60])
result = viz.plot_band_spectrum(trace, 0.05, bandwidth=1.0)
plt.show()
```
